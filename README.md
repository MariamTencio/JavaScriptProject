It maintains and shows the total balance, and adds income and expenses. The program also allows the possibility to remove a transaction from the list.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used Html, CSS and JavaScript

# Useful Websites

{Make a list of websites that you found helpful in this project}

- Web Site Name: (https://validator.w3.org/)
- Web Site Name: (http://chatgpt.com) Chat GPT was mainly used to get information on how to build the css to look better and get color codes and get recommendations.

# Future Work

I would like to have the information stored and be able to load it again and keep editing because right now every time you reload the code the information is lost.
